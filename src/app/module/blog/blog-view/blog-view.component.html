        <p>In the early days of programming, we were taught to write code from scratch, to understand every line and every function. But as technology advanced, we found ourselves relying more and more on tools that did the heavy lifting for us. Autocomplete features in IDEs became our crutch, allowing us to write code faster but at the cost of our understanding.</p>
        <p>Now, as we stand on the brink of a new era dominated by AI, we must ask ourselves: have we lost our coding brain? Are we so dependent on these tools that we've forgotten how to think like a programmer?</p>
        <p>Join me on this journey as I attempt to rebuild my coding brain, one line of code at a time.</p>
